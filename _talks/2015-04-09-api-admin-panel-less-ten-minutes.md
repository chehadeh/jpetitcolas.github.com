Create an REST API is a very time-consuming task, even if there are some famous bundles such as [FOSRestBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle).
Fortunately, some third libraries give priority to *convention over configuration* philosophy. This is especially the
case for [stanlemon/rest-bundle](https://github.com/stanlemon/rest-bundle). As for the administration panel, we will use
[ng-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin), an Angular.js admin GUI for REST API.
